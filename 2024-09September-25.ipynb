    "There are other data structures that are useful to know about, and which have their places:\n",
    "- Strings (for text)\n",
    "- Lists (for general storage)\n",
    "- Sets (sort of like the keys for dicts)\n",
    "- Variations on dicts (e.g., Counter and defaultdict)\n",

    "Python has about 20-30 \"builtin\" names. We typically talk about them as functions, but many of them are not. Rather, many are classes, i.e., data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int`\n",
    "- `float`\n",
    "- `str`\n",
    "- `list`\n",
    "- `tuple`\n",

    "Even though these are look and feel like functions, they aren't. By contrast, there are a bunch of functions:\n",

    "- `print`\n",
    "- `input`\n",
    "- `sum`\n",

    "At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter if they're functions or classes. In the end, you invoke them for a particular purpose."

    "2. If the same code appears in several places in a program, we should put the code in a single place (a function) and then invoke the function whenever we want that functionality.\n",
    "3. If the same code appears in several different programs, then we put it in a single place (a \"library\") and then use that library any time we need the code.\n",

    "Every programming language (just about) supports libraries, because they are so useful.\n",

    "In Python, we call our \"libraries\" modules, and they service *two* functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can store variables/functions/class definitions in a module, and then use the module whenever we need that functionality.\n",
    "2. They serve as namespaces, ensuring that if two different programmers, in two different files, use the same variable name, we won't have to worry about at clash between them.\n"
