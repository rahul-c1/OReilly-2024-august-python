    "This doesn't mean that dicts should be used in place of anything/everything else! \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other data structures that are useful to know about, and which have their places:\n",
    "- Strings (for text)\n",
    "- Lists (for general storage)\n",
    "- Sets (sort of like the keys for dicts)\n",
    "- Variations on dicts (e.g., Counter and defaultdict)\n",

    "Python has about 20-30 \"builtin\" names. We typically talk about them as functions, but many of them are not. Rather, many are classes, i.e., data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int`\n",
    "- `float`\n",
    "- `str`\n",
    "- `list`\n",
    "- `tuple`\n",
    "- `dict`\n",
    "- `set`\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We can store variables/functions/class definitions in a module, and then use the module whenever we need that functionality.\n",
